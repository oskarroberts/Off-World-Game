In the far future, Earth has reached its maximum capacity. Those rich (or important enough) may stay on earth whereas those considered undesirable will be shipped... Off-World.
Thus we are brought to our protagonist, a young man named Lukas who upon turning 18 will be forced to leave his homeplanet with nothing but his possesions and the connections he has made.
Soon he shall wake, to enjoy the last 3 days before his departure.
