Something feels different about today...

(A long day passes quickly at Lukas's house)
Friends: Lukas we're going to miss you buddy. I know we're able to communicate digitally but it just wont be the same without you. We haven't been the best friends to those that went Off-Worldâ„¢ before you and i think we'd like to change that.
Friends: We wont ever forget you Lukas, you're our friend.
(The others soon departed leaving Lukas to his slumber)
